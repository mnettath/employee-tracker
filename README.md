# employee-tracker

## Description

I built this employee-tracker app in order to help business owners view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company. This helps to better organize and plan the business. Working on this app gave me more practice using database queries, creating SQL tables, and seeding the data. A challenge that I had while working on this app was getting the department, role, and employee tables to all work together and update. While this is still a work in progress, I found that including callbacks to the viewAll functions, helped keep the tables current.

## Installation

In order to use the employee-tacker, the user must install node.js. Node.js can be installed using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download. It's important to download the LTS option for the computer's operating system. The user will also need to install the inquirer package by inputting "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in the command line. Next, the user must make sure that they have mySQL Workbench installed and then run "mysql -u -root -p". Finally, the user must run an "npm i" in the command line to import node_modules.

To begin, please copy and paste the contents of the schema.sql to create the tables in SQL Workbench. Next, copy and paste the contents of seeds.sql, into SQL Workbench. Now we are ready to run "node index.js" in the command line and get started!
